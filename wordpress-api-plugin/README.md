# Wordpress API Plugin #

## Overview ##
During the process of creating the Widget, I ended up creating both a Widget, and a Plugin that can be called using a shorthand. I decided to include them both in the submission of the assignment. The Wordpress Plugin is a single file. The .zip file can be directly installed in Wordpress. The short-command to call the function, and list the articles, is [articles-api].

## Live Version ##
The Plugin has been tested, and a published version can be found on: http://ralphblackferguson.com/programs/wordpress/

## Challenges ##
As far as I have understood, a Plugin in Wordpress can/should include a relatively large number of files â€” for security and other reasons. I tried to create a Plugin using the boilerplate generated on https://wppb.me/, but there seemed to be a lot of code that needed to be filled in, and I made the decision to limit to scope of this project to not include the excess files.
